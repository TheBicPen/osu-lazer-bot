## Project Status
This project is no longer under active development. Videos created by this project while it was active can be seen [here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWUoXuSht6uy-evWTxpKFcQ). If anyone wants to take over the project, please go ahead.

There are a few reasons for the ceased development: 
- I've learned much during this project, and there's not much left to learn here
- My computer broke and I don't want to spend time setting this up again
- [osu-bot](https://github.com/christopher-dG/osu-bot) makes this obsolete
- The time spent running this service isn't worth it given the low view count
